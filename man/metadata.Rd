The metadata table explains the meanings of data in
the events table, which is retrieved through the
exportData() function. It has three fields to describe
what the general shape of the data is, while the other
fields describe what data is stored in the field with that 
name in the events table.
}

* Code_name is the XML code of this type of data
* long_name is an english description of what it is
* primary_column is what columns of the events table 
     stores the observation value for this data type
* All others: a plain english description of what is stored 
     in that column in the events table. NA if nothing.

**not** a connection to database table.
